# youtube-dl-playlist-bash
This is a bash script which will run a youtube-dl command to download every song in a public playlist and convert it to a high quality mp3, as well as keep history in a txt file so that repeat videos are not downloaded. Metadata such as thumbnail and filename format will also be fetched from the src song.
